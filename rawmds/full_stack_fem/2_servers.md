# SERVERS

## What is a server?
    A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.

### Key concepts
    virtualization: divide server resourses into virtual computers
    virtual machine: digital version of a physical computer
    VPS: virtual private server
    
### Random

### Security & SHH Keys
    - Dictionary attack: a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary
    - MD5, SHA1, SHA256: Some hashing algorithms
    - Hasing + SALT: SALT is a random string added to the password before hashing. This makes it harder to crack the password.
